[Image Slider](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-dynamic-user-interface-interactions#image-slider)

Create a simple image carousel. It should contain arrows on each side to advance the image forward or backward. It should automatically move forward every 5 seconds. It should contain the little navigation circles at the bottom that indicate which slide you are on (and they should be click-able to advance to that particular slide).
