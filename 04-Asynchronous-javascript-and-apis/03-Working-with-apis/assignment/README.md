- Code project following along with lesson
- Expand on our little project here by adding a button that fetches a new image without refreshing the page.
- Add a search box so users can search for specific gifs. You should also investigate adding a .catch() to the end of the promise chain in case Giphy doesnâ€™t find any gifs with the searched keyword. Add a default image, or an error message if the search fails.
