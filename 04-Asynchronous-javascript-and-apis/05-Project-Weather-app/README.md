# [Project: Weather App](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-javascript-weather-app)

- Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to your JavaScript and CSS files.
- Write the functions that hit the API. You’re going to want functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.
- Write the functions that process the JSON data you’re getting from the API and return an object with only the data you require for your app.
- Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
- Display the information on your webpage!
- Add any styling you like!
- Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
- Push that baby to github and share your solution below!
